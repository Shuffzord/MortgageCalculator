# Smart Loan Calculator Enhancement Architectural Prompt

## Project Context

You are an AI architect tasked with designing a comprehensive enhancement plan for an existing smart loan calculator application. The application is currently front-end only but requires expansion to include server-side functionality, user accounts, and premium payment features.

## Current Application

- **Type**: Smart loan calculator with advanced features
- **Technology**: TypeScript/JavaScript front-end only
- **Current Functionality**: Advanced loan calculations (amortization, interest rates, comparison tools, etc.)
- **Current Limitations**: No persistence, no user accounts, no payment processing

## Enhancement Requirements

### 1. Server-Side Implementation

- **Technology Constraints**:
  - Must use TypeScript/JavaScript stack (Node.js ecosystem)
  - Must be cost-effective for a small, new project
  - Will be hosted on Render.com
- **Expected Functionality**:
  - API endpoints for loan calculations
  - Data persistence
  - User authentication
  - Premium feature access control

### 2. User Account System

- **Core Requirements**:
  - Username/email and password authentication
  - Secure storage of user credentials
  - Password reset capability
  - JSON data storage for user preferences and saved calculations
  - Account management (update profile, delete account)
- **Data Storage Needs**:
  - Small JSON data objects (saved calculations, preferences)
  - User profile information
  - Premium feature access rights

### 3. Premium Membership System

- **Structure**:
  - Feature-based premium access (users pay for specific premium features)
  - Different tiers or individual feature purchases
- **Access Control**:
  - Method to verify premium status before providing access to premium features
  - Graceful handling of non-premium users attempting to access premium features

### 4. Payment Processing

- **Payment Type**:
  - Recurring yearly subscriptions
  - Potential one-time purchases for specific features
- **Integration**:
  - Preferably Stripe (but open to alternatives with justification)
  - Secure payment flow
  - Handling payment failures and retries
  - Receipt generation

### 5. Database Requirements

- **Size**: Small-scale database suitable for a new application
- **Data Types**:
  - User accounts
  - Authentication data
  - User preferences/settings
  - Saved calculations
  - Payment and subscription records
- **Considerations**:
  - Cost-effectiveness
  - Easy management
  - Compatible with TypeScript/JavaScript stack

## Design Priorities

1. **Functionality Over Scalability**: Focus on getting a working system first
2. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Both development and operational costs should be minimized
3. **Future-Proofing**: Design should allow for scaling in the distant future without major rework
4. **Security**: Properly secure user data and payment information

## Deliverables Required

1. **Technology Stack Recommendation**
   - Server framework (Express.js, Nest.js, etc.)
   - Database selection with justification (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Firebase, etc.)
   - Authentication system (custom, Auth0, Firebase Auth, etc.)
   - Payment processing implementation (Stripe, alternatives if better suited)

2. **Architecture Diagram**
   - Component interaction overview
   - Data flow between components
   - Clear separation of concerns

3. **Database Schema**
   - Proposed data models
   - Relationships between entities
   - Indexing strategy for performance

4. **API Design**
   - RESTful or GraphQL approach with justification
   - Endpoint structure for all required functionality
   - Authentication and authorization flow
   - Rate limiting and security considerations

5. **User Account System Design**
   - Registration flow
   - Authentication mechanism
   - Password policies and security
   - User data management

6. **Premium Feature Access Control**
   - How premium features are defined and accessed
   - Implementation of per-feature premium access
   - Integration with payment system

7. **Payment System Integration**
   - Payment provider configuration
   - Subscription management
   - Handling payment events (successful payments, failures, etc.)
   - Webhooks and notifications

8. **Security Measures**
   - Data encryption strategy
   - Authentication security
   - OWASP top 10 mitigation
   - Payment data security compliance (PCI DSS considerations)

9. **Deployment Strategy**
   - Render.com configuration recommendations
   - Environment setup (development, staging, production)
   - CI/CD approach if applicable
   - Backup and recovery plan

10. **Implementation Roadmap**
    - Phased approach with milestones
    - Suggested implementation order
    - Testing strategy
    - Potential challenges and mitigation strategies

11. **Cost Estimation**
    - Development effort estimation
    - Ongoing operational costs breakdown
    - Scaling cost projections

## Additional Guidelines

- Prioritize proven, stable technologies over cutting-edge options
- Consider the solo developer or small team context in your recommendations
- Provide specific code examples or configuration snippets where particularly helpful
- Highlight any potential technical debt or future migration concerns
- Suggest specific packages/libraries that would accelerate development
- Address potential scaling bottlenecks even if not immediate concerns
- Ensure all recommendations align with TypeScript/JavaScript ecosystem
- Consider developer experience and maintenance overhead in your recommendations
