# Mortgage Calculator Architecture Analysis

## System Overview

The mortgage calculator is a comprehensive web application that allows users to calculate mortgage payments, amortization schedules, and analyze different loan scenarios including overpayments and interest rate changes. The application is built using React for the frontend and TypeScript for type safety.

## Architecture Assessment

### 1. Component Analysis

#### Core Calculation Components

##### Component: Calculation Engine (`calculationEngine.ts`)

**Overview**
- **Primary functionality**: Core calculation logic for mortgage amortization, overpayments, and interest calculations
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Incoming: OverpaymentOptimizationPanel, tests, mortgage-calculator.ts
  - Outgoing: types.ts, utils.ts, validation.ts, mortgage-calculator.ts
- **Risk level for refactoring**: High - This is the critical path of the application

**Issues Identified**
1. Complex parameter lists with multiple optional parameters
2. Circular dependency with mortgage-calculator.ts
3. Mixed responsibilities (calculation and some presentation logic)
4. Inconsistent error handling
5. Duplicate calculation logic
6. Complex overpayment handling spread across multiple functions

**Recommended Improvements**
1. Introduce parameter objects for complex function signatures
2. Break circular dependencies by extracting shared logic
3. Separate calculation from presentation logic
4. Standardize error handling
5. Refactor overpayment logic into a dedicated module

##### Component: Optimization Engine (`optimizationEngine.ts`)

**Overview**
- **Primary functionality**: Analyzes and optimizes overpayment strategies
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Incoming: OverpaymentOptimizationPanel
  - Outgoing: calculationEngine.ts, types.ts, utils.ts
- **Risk level for refactoring**: Medium

**Issues Identified**
1. Tight coupling with calculation engine
2. Complex strategy evaluation logic
3. Limited strategy types that cannot be easily extended

**Recommended Improvements**
1. Implement Strategy pattern for different optimization approaches
2. Create interface for calculation engine to reduce coupling
3. Simplify effectiveness ratio calculation

##### Component: Utility Functions (`utils.ts`)

**Overview**
- **Primary functionality**: Common utility functions for calculations and formatting
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Incoming: Most other modules
  - Outgoing: types.ts, external libraries
- **Risk level for refactoring**: High - Widely used across the codebase

**Issues Identified**
1. Mixed concerns (calculation utilities and formatting functions)
2. Duplicate logic with calculationEngine.ts
3. Complex amortization schedule generation function

**Recommended Improvements**
1. Split into separate modules by concern (calculation, formatting, date utilities)
2. Refactor amortization schedule generation into smaller functions
3. Create dedicated number formatting module

#### UI Components

##### Component: Overpayment Optimization Panel (`OverpaymentOptimizationPanel.tsx`)

**Overview**
- **Primary functionality**: UI for optimizing overpayments
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Incoming: HomePage component
  - Outgoing: optimizationEngine.ts, types.ts, utils.ts
- **Risk level for refactoring**: Medium

**Issues Identified**
1. Large component (700+ lines) with multiple responsibilities
2. Direct calculation engine calls from UI
3. Chart rendering logic mixed with UI

**Recommended Improvements**
1. Break down into smaller components
2. Introduce service layer between UI and calculation logic
3. Extract chart logic to dedicated module

### 2. System-Wide Issues

1. **Tight Coupling**: Many components are tightly coupled, making changes risky
2. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Different approaches to error handling across the codebase
3. **Limited Separation of Concerns**: Business logic and presentation logic are often mixed
4. **Complex Parameter Passing**: Functions often have many parameters, some optional
5. **Circular Dependencies**: Circular dependency between calculationEngine.ts and mortgage-calculator.ts

### 3. Code Quality Assessment

#### Strengths
1. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript types throughout the codebase
2. **Test Coverage**: Extensive test suite for core calculation logic
3. **Modular Structure**: Basic separation into logical modules
4. **Internationalization**: Support for multiple languages

#### Weaknesses
1. **Code Duplication**: Similar logic appears in multiple places
2. **Complex Functions**: Some functions are overly complex with many responsibilities
3. **Inconsistent Patterns**: Different patterns used for similar problems
4. **Limited Documentation**: Some complex algorithms lack detailed documentation

#### SOLID Principles Assessment
1. **Single Responsibility**: Many components handle multiple responsibilities
2. **Open/Closed**: Limited extensibility, especially in optimization strategies
3. **Liskov Substitution**: Generally followed where inheritance is used
4. **Interface Segregation**: Some interfaces are too broad
5. **Dependency Inversion**: Direct dependencies rather than abstractions

## Conclusion

The mortgage calculator application has a solid foundation but suffers from several architectural issues that affect maintainability and extensibility. By addressing these issues through a phased approach, we can improve the codebase while minimizing risk.

The most critical areas to address are the complex parameter handling in the calculation engine, the circular dependencies between components, and the mixed responsibilities in various modules. By focusing on these areas first, we can establish a better foundation for further improvements.

The proposed refactoring plan balances the need for architectural improvements with the practical constraints of maintaining a working application. Each phase builds on the previous one, gradually transforming the architecture while ensuring the application remains functional throughout the process.
