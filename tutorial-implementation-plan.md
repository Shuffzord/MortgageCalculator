```

## Experience Level Assessment

### Welcome Dialog
```typescript
interface ExperienceLevel {
  level: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
  preferences: {
    detailLevel: 'basic' | 'detailed';
    includeExamples: boolean;
    showCalculations: boolean;
  };
}
```

### Friendly Welcome Message Examples
1. **Initial Greeting**
   ```
   "Welcome to Your Mortgage Calculator! ðŸ‘‹
   We're here to help you understand your mortgage options.
   To provide the best guidance, we'd love to know a bit about your experience."
   ```

2. **Experience Assessment**
   - Question: "How familiar are you with mortgage calculations?"
   - Options:
     ```
     ðŸŒ± "I'm new to this - please guide me through everything"
     ðŸ“š "I know the basics but want to learn more"
     ðŸŽ“ "I'm experienced and just need quick references"
     ```

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Loan Amount Configuration**
   ```typescript
   const loanSetupStep = {
     title: "Setting Up Your Loan",
     example: {
       homePrice: 400000,
       downPayment: 80000,
       loanAmount: 320000,
       explanation: "With a 20% down payment on a $400,000 home, your loan amount would be $320,000"
     }
   };
   ```

2. **Loan Term Selection**
   ```typescript
   const loanTermStep = {
     title: "Choosing Your Loan Term",
     comparison: {
       "30-year": {
         payment: "$1,527/month",
         totalInterest: "$229,720"
       },
       "15-year": {
         payment: "$2,372/month",
         totalInterest: "$106,960"
       }
     }
   };
   ```

3. **Interest Rate Configuration**
   ```typescript
   const interestRateStep = {
     title: "Setting Up Interest Rates",
     periods: [
       {
         years: "1-5",
         rate: "3.5%",
         payment: "$1,437/month"
       },
       {
         years: "6-30",
         rate: "4.5%",
         payment: "$1,520/month"
       }
     ]
   };
   ```

4. **Overpayment Plans**
   ```typescript
   const overpaymentStep = {
     examples: [
       {
         type: "Monthly",
         amount: "$200/month",
         impact: {
           termReduction: "4 years",
           interestSaving: "$45,320"
         }
       },
       {
         type: "Annual",
         amount: "$5,000/year",
         impact: {
           termReduction: "6 years",
           interestSaving: "$67,840"
         }
       }
     ]
   };
   ```
