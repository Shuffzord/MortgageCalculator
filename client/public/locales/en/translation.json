      "example": "On a $300,000 mortgage, additional costs might include a $3,000 origination fee, $1,500 annual property insurance, $3,600 annual property taxes, and potentially $1,800 annual PMI.",

      "impact": "Understanding your amortization schedule helps you see how much of your payment goes to interest versus principal at different points in the loan, and how additional payments would affect the loan.",
      "example": "An amortization schedule would show that in the first payment of a 30-year $300,000 mortgage at 4%, about $1,000 goes to interest and only $432 to principal, while in year 25, about $300 goes to interest and $1,132 to principal.",
