# Security Policy

We take the security of this project seriously. Thank you for responsibly reporting vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

We generally support the latest code on the `main` branch and the most recent release. Security fixes may not be backported to older versions unless severity warrants it.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not create public issues for security vulnerabilities.

- Preferred: Use GitHub’s “Report a vulnerability” (Security Advisories) if enabled for this repository.
- If advisories are unavailable: open a minimal issue titled "Security report – request maintainer contact" without details. A maintainer will follow up privately.

Provide, where possible:

- A clear description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or a proof of concept
- Affected versions/commit(s) and environment details
- Suggested remediation (if known)

We aim to acknowledge within 3 business days and will coordinate on a fix, disclosure timing, and credit.

## Safe Harbor

We will not pursue legal action for good-faith security research that:

- Avoids data exfiltration or privacy violations
- Does not degrade or disrupt service for other users
- Respects rate limits and applicable laws

If in doubt, contact us first via the reporting steps above.
