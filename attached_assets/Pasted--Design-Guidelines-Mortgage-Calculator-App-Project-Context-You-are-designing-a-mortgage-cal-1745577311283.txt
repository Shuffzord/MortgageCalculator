# Design Guidelines: Mortgage Calculator App

## Project Context
You are designing a mortgage calculator web application that will stand out not just for its functional capabilities but also for its beautiful, intuitive design. The calculator will handle complex financial calculations while presenting information in a visually engaging and easily understandable manner.

## Design Goals

### Primary Goals
1. Create a beautiful interface that elevates financial calculations beyond typical calculator aesthetics
2. Design an intuitive flow that guides users through complex financial decisions
3. Make data visualization elegant and immediately comprehensible
4. Balance professional finance aesthetics with modern design principles
5. Support educational components that enhance understanding without overwhelming

## Brand Identity & Design Language

### Color Palette
- **Primary palette**: Use a sophisticated, trustworthy color scheme
  - Main color: A deep blue-green (#1A6B72) for primary elements and key actions
  - Secondary color: A warm accent color (#E8A87C) for highlighting important information
  - Background: Light, neutral tones (#F8F9FA, #FFFFFF) to keep the focus on the content
  - Text: Dark gray (#333333) for regular text, deeper (#111111) for headings

- **Extended palette**:
  - Success/positive: Muted green (#2E8B57)
  - Warning/caution: Soft amber (#F5B041)
  - Error/alert: Subdued red (#C0392B)
  - Information: Calm blue (#3498DB)

- **Chart colors**: Create a harmonious gradient of 5-7 colors derived from your primary palette for consistent data visualization

### Typography
- **Primary font**: Choose a clean, professional sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Work Sans, or Nunito)
- **Secondary font**: Optional serif font for headings to add sophistication (e.g., Merriweather, Playfair Display)
- **Hierarchy**:
  - H1: 28-32px, bold/semi-bold
  - H2: 22-24px, bold/semi-bold
  - H3: 18-20px, semi-bold
  - Body: 16px, regular
  - Small text/captions: 14px
  - Micro text (tooltips): 12px

- **Line height**: 1.5 for body text, 1.2-1.3 for headings
- **Font weight variation**: Use weight (not just size) to establish hierarchy

### Iconography & Visual Elements
- **Icon style**: Consistent, simple line icons with rounded corners
- **Visual metaphors**: Use appropriate financial metaphors (coins, charts, calendar) sparingly
- **Educational indicators**: Create a consistent visual language for educational elements (e.g., dotted underline for terms with tooltips)

## Layout & Structure

### Spacing System
- Implement an 8px grid system (8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 40px, 48px, etc.)
- Maintain consistent spacing between related elements
- Use generous whitespace to separate distinct functional areas

### Layout Structure
- Implement a clear visual hierarchy with primary input area, visualization area, and results area
- Use cards or distinct containers to group related information
- Consider a multi-step process for complex calculations with clear progression indicators

### Responsive Design
- Design mobile-first but optimize for desktop (where financial planning often occurs)
- Ensure visualizations adapt gracefully to different screen sizes
- Use breakpoints that make sense for the content (not just standard device sizes)

## Component Design

### Form Elements
- **Inputs**: Slightly larger than standard (48px height minimum) for easy interaction
- **Labels**: Always visible, not placeholder text that disappears
- **Validation**: Immediate, inline validation with helpful error messages
- **Sliders**: Use for ranges with visible value indicators and proper touch targets
- **Number inputs**: Include increment/decrement controls and proper formatting
- **Field grouping**: Visually connect related fields

### Data Visualization
- **Charts**: Clean, minimal design with subtle grid lines
- **Colors**: Use consistent color coding across all charts (e.g., blue always represents principal)
- **Legends**: Clear, integrated legends that explain data representation
- **Interactivity**: Implement subtle hover states showing precise values
- **Transitions**: Smooth transitions when data changes
- **Scale**: Appropriate scales with visible min/max values
- **Context**: Always provide context for what the visualization means

### Results Display
- **Hierarchy**: Clear visual distinction between primary results and supporting details
- **Formatting**: Proper currency formatting with appropriate decimal places
- **Grouping**: Logical grouping of related values
- **Comparison**: Visual cues when comparing different scenarios

### Educational Elements
- **Tooltips**: Consistent design for explanation tooltips
- **Info icons**: Subtle but recognizable icons indicating additional information
- **Glossary items**: Visually distinct styling for terms linked to definitions
- **Contextual help**: Accessible help that doesn't interrupt the main workflow

## Interaction Design

### Microinteractions
- Subtle animations when updating values (0.2-0.3s duration)
- Visual feedback on all interactions (button presses, slider movements)
- Loading states that maintain layout stability
- Smooth transitions between different calculator states

### User Guidance
- Progressive disclosure of complex options
- Clear affordances for interactive elements
- Visual cues indicating where user input is required
- Step indicators for multi-stage processes

### Accessibility Considerations
- Minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for text (WCAG AA compliance)
- Focus states visible and consistent across all interactive elements
- Touch targets minimum 44px Ã— 44px
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly structure and aria labels

## Implementation Notes

### Design System Components
Develop these core components with consistent styling:
- Input fields (text, number, date)
- Dropdown selects
- Sliders/range inputs
- Buttons (primary, secondary, tertiary)
- Toggle switches
- Tooltips and popovers
- Cards/containers
- Data visualizations (charts, graphs)
- Results displays
- Educational indicators

### Design Deliverables
- Component library in your design tool of choice
- Style guide documenting colors, typography, spacing
- Interactive prototype of key user flows
- Responsive layouts for critical screens
- Animation specifications for key interactions

## POC Design Refinements

### POC-Specific Focus Areas
1. **Input Form Redesign**:
   - Create a more visually appealing input area with proper grouping
   - Implement better number formatting for currency inputs
   - Add visual sliders alongside number inputs for key values

2. **Results Visualization Enhancements**:
   - Redesign charts with the new color system
   - Add meaningful animations when switching between scenarios
   - Improve legends and contextual information

3. **Educational Layer**:
   - Design a consistent system for displaying financial term definitions
   - Create visual indicators for educational content
   - Implement clean, minimal tooltips that don't obstruct content

4. **Navigation & Flow**:
   - Design a clear multi-step process if applicable
   - Improve the visual connection between inputs and their resulting outputs
   - Create visual differentiation between basic and advanced options

Remember that beautiful design in financial tools comes from clarity, consistency, and thoughtful data presentation rather than decorative elements. Focus on making complex information feel simple and approachable through your design choices.
