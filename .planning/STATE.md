## Session History

### 2026-02-17 - Phase 1 Context Gathered
- Discussed type strictness, file organization, naming conventions, extensibility
- Created 01-CONTEXT.md with implementation decisions

### 2026-02-17 - Project Initialization
- Created PROJECT.md from codebase analysis
- Completed deep research on WebMCP
- Created REQUIREMENTS.md
- Created ROADMAP.md with 5 phases

## Context for Next Session

**What we're building:** WebMCP integration for mortgage calculator
**Why:** Demo/showcase of WebMCP capabilities with AI agents
**Key decision:** Start with single `calculateMortgage` tool, expand later

**Research completed:**
- WebMCP patterns (imperative API)
- React integration (standalone module)
- Calculator mapping (LoanDetails ↔ tool input)
- Testing approach (Jest mock + Chrome extension)

**Next step:** Plan phase 1 (TypeScript Foundation)
