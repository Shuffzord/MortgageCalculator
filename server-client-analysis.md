## Analysis of Options for Separating the App into Client and Server Components

This document outlines the analysis of potential options for separating the mortgage calculator app into client and server components. The goal is to implement premium features, store client-specific data, and improve the overall architecture of the application.

### Options Considered

1.  **Serverless Functions (e.g., Azure Functions, Render Functions, AWS Lambda):**
    - Move the calculation logic to serverless functions.
    - The client-side React app would call these functions via API requests.
    - **Pros:** Cost-effective for low to moderate usage, easy to scale, no server management.
    - **Cons:** Potential cold start latency, limited execution time, more complex deployment.
2.  **Traditional Server (e.g., Node.js/Express):**
    - Create a REST API using Node.js and Express to handle calculations and data storage.
    - The client-side React app would communicate with this API.
    - **Pros:** More control over the server environment, easier to debug, better performance for complex calculations.
    - **Cons:** Higher cost due to server maintenance, more complex setup and deployment.
3.  **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) (e.g., Firebase, Supabase):**
    - Use a BaaS platform to handle authentication, data storage, and serverless functions.
    - The client-side React app would interact with the BaaS platform's APIs.
    - **Pros:** Easy to set up and use, handles many backend tasks, cost-effective for small to medium-sized projects.
    - **Cons:** Limited control over the backend, potential vendor lock-in, may not be suitable for complex requirements.

### Criteria for Choosing Between Options

- **Cost:** Hosting costs, database costs, authentication costs, payment processing fees
- **Scalability:** Ability to handle increasing traffic and data volume
- **Maintainability:** Ease of development, deployment, and maintenance
- **Security:** Protection of sensitive data and prevention of unauthorized access
- **Performance:** Speed and responsiveness of the application
- **Complexity:** Ease of implementation and integration
- **Familiarity:** Existing knowledge and experience with the technologies

### Analysis

The following table compares the options based on the criteria:

| Criteria        | Serverless Functions | Traditional Server | BaaS (Firebase/Supabase) |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Cost            | Low (for low usage)  | Medium to High     | Low to Medium            |
| Scalability     | High                 | Medium             | High                     |
| Maintainability | Medium               | High               | Low                      |
| Security        | Medium               | High               | Medium                   |
| Performance     | Medium               | High               | Medium                   |
| Complexity      | Medium               | High               | Low                      |
| Familiarity     | Medium               | High               | Low                      |

### Chosen Option: Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) with Firebase

Based on the user's requirements and constraints (hobby project with limited budget, need to add Stripe integration, need user authentication, need a cost-effective database solution, potential hosting platforms are Render or Azure), the best option is **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) (e.g., Firebase, Supabase)**.

Firebase was chosen as the BaaS platform due to the following reasons:

- **Cost:** Firebase offers a generous free tier and cost-effective pricing for small to medium-sized projects.
- **Scalability:** Firebase automatically scales to handle increasing traffic and data volume.
- **Maintainability:** Firebase handles many backend tasks, reducing the maintenance burden.
- **Complexity:** Firebase is easy to set up and use, making it ideal for hobby projects.
- **Stripe Integration:** Firebase has good support for Stripe integration.
- **User Authentication:** Firebase offers an easy-to-use authentication service.
- **Database:** Firebase offers a cost-effective NoSQL database (Firestore).
