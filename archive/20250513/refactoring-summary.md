# Mortgage Calculator Refactoring Project Summary

## Overview
This archive contains documentation from the major refactoring project completed on May 13, 2025. The project successfully transformed the Mortgage Calculator application from a tightly coupled, difficult-to-maintain codebase into a modular, well-organized system with clear separation of concerns.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Breaking Circular Dependencies**
   - Created a new `calculationCore.ts` module for shared logic
   - Eliminated circular dependency between `calculationEngine.ts` and `mortgage-calculator.ts`

2. **Separation of Calculation from Presentation**
   - Created a dedicated `formatters.ts` module for all formatting functions
   - Removed formatting logic from calculation modules

3. **Extraction of Overpayment Logic**
   - Created a dedicated `overpaymentCalculator.ts` module
   - Simplified complex overpayment calculations

4. **Introduction of Service Layer**
   - Created a `calculationService.ts` module to mediate between UI and calculation logic
   - Decoupled UI components from calculation implementation details

5. **Parameter Objects**
   - Introduced parameter objects for complex function signatures
   - Improved code readability and maintainability

## Architectural Improvements

The refactoring transformed the architecture from a tightly coupled system with circular dependencies to a clean, modular architecture with:

- **Core Calculation Layer**: `calculationCore.ts` providing fundamental calculation functions
- **Specialized Calculation Modules**: `calculationEngine.ts` and `overpaymentCalculator.ts` focusing on specific domains
- **Formatting Layer**: `formatters.ts` centralizing all presentation-related formatting logic
- **Service Layer**: `calculationService.ts` mediating between UI components and calculation logic
- **Clear Dependencies**: All modules with unidirectional dependencies without circular references
