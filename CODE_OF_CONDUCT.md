# Code of Conduct

We are committed to fostering a welcoming, safe, and collaborative community. All participants — maintainers, contributors, and users — are expected to follow this Code of Conduct in all project spaces.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and considerate
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, discrimination, or exclusionary behavior
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
- Sustained disruption of discussions

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (issues, PRs, discussions, code reviews, and any community communications) and when an individual is representing the project in public spaces.

## Reporting and Enforcement

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by opening an issue or contacting the maintainers via the project’s GitHub Discussions/Issues. We will review and respond to every report.

Enforcement actions may include:

- A private warning
- Temporary or permanent removal from community spaces
- Reverting or removing contributions that violate this policy

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of Conduct and may take any action they deem appropriate for any behavior they consider inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant (v2.1) and other open-source community policies.
