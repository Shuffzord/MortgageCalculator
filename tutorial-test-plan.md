# Tutorial Implementation Test Plan

## 1. State Management Tests

### Experience Level Selection
1. Open experience level assessment dialog
2. Select each experience level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
3. Verify state updates in console logs:
   - `[ExperienceLevelAssessment] Experience level changed`
   - `[TutorialState] Setting experience level`
4. Refresh page and verify experience level persists

### Step Progression
1. Start tutorial for each experience level
2. Navigate through steps
3. Verify in console logs:
   - `[TutorialOverlay] Step completed`
   - `[TutorialState] Completing step`
4. Verify step count matches experience level
5. Refresh during tutorial and verify progress maintains

### Tutorial Completion
1. Complete full tutorial flow
2. Verify completion logs:
   - `[TutorialOverlay] Tutorial ending`
   - Analytics events for completion
3. Skip tutorial mid-way
4. Verify abandonment logs and state reset

## 2. Component Integration Tests

### Overlay Rendering
1. Check tutorial overlay z-index and positioning
2. Verify overlay adapts to different screen sizes
3. Test overlay interaction with page scrolling
4. Validate step highlighting and focus

### Navigation Controls
1. Test Next/Previous buttons
2. Verify Skip functionality
3. Test keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Esc)
4. Validate progress indicator accuracy

### Analytics Integration
1. Monitor analytics events in console:
   - Tutorial start
   - Step completion
   - Experience level changes
   - Tutorial completion/abandonment
2. Verify event data accuracy

### Mobile Testing
1. Test on different screen sizes:
   - Small mobile (320px)
   - Large mobile (425px)
   - Tablet (768px)
2. Verify overlay positioning
3. Test touch interactions
4. Check step content readability

## 3. Edge Cases

### Browser Refresh
1. Refresh during experience selection
2. Refresh mid-tutorial
3. Refresh on final step
4. Verify state recovery in each case

### Navigation Interruption
1. Test browser back/forward during tutorial
2. Navigate to different routes during tutorial
3. Verify tutorial state handles interruptions

### Accessibility
1. Test with screen reader
2. Verify ARIA attributes
3. Test keyboard-only navigation
4. Check color contrast compliance

## Test Execution Steps

1. Enable console logging in browser
2. Clear browser storage before each test
3. Record any unexpected behavior
