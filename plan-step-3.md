# Plan Step 3: Test Case Adjustments and Creation

## Goal
Modify existing test cases and create new test cases to ensure the variable interest rate functionality is working correctly.

### 3.1. Existing Test Cases (`client/src/lib/comprehensive-tests/basic-validation.test.ts`, `client/src/lib/simple-fixes-test.test.ts`)
- **Action**: Modify the existing test cases to use the new `LoanDetails` interface.
    - Create `LoanDetails` objects with the appropriate properties.
    - Update the expected values in the test assertions to reflect the new functionality.
- **Safe Check**: Run the existing test cases to ensure that the changes have not broken any existing functionality.

### 3.2. New Test Cases (`client/src/lib/comprehensive-tests/variable-rate.test.ts`)
- **Action**: Create a new test file (`client/src/lib/comprehensive-tests/variable-rate.test.ts`) to test the variable interest rate functionality.
- **Test Cases**:
    - **VR1: Single Interest Rate Period**: Test a loan with a single interest rate period.
    - **VR2: Multiple Interest Rate Periods**: Test a loan with multiple interest rate periods.
    - **VR3: Interest Rate Change During Loan Term**: Test a loan with an interest rate change during the loan term.
    - **VR4: Zero Interest Rate Period**: Test a loan with a zero interest rate period.
    - **VR5: Edge Cases**: Test edge cases such as very high or very low interest rates, very short or very long loan terms, and zero principal.
- **Safe Check**: Ensure that the new test cases cover all the different scenarios and edge cases for variable interest rates.

### 3.3. Test Case Structure
- **Structure**: Each test case should follow a similar structure:
    1.  **Define Inputs**: Define the loan parameters, including the `interestRatePeriods` property.
    2.  **Calculate Expected Values**: Calculate the expected monthly payment, total interest, and other relevant values.
    3.  **Get Calculation Results**: Call the `calculateLoanDetails` function with the loan parameters.
    4.  **Validate Results**: Use `expect` assertions to validate that the calculated values match the expected values.
