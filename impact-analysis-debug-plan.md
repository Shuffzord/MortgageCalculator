# Impact Analysis Panel Debugging Plan

## Identified Issues

After analyzing the code, I've identified several possible reasons why the impact analysis panel isn't appearing:

1. **Conditional Rendering Restriction**: 
   The panel only renders when both `overpaymentResults` and `impactData` are non-null:
   ```jsx
   {overpaymentResults && impactData && (
     <div className="md:col-span-3 bg-green-50 p-4 rounded-lg border border-green-100 mt-4">
       {/* Panel content */}
     </div>
   )}
   ```

2. **Monthly Overpayment Requirement**: 
   The current implementation only calculates impact data when there's a monthly overpayment:
   ```javascript
   const maxMonthlyAmount = loanDetails.overpaymentPlans.reduce((max, plan) => {
     if (plan.frequency === 'monthly') {
       return Math.max(max, plan.amount);
     }
     return max;
   }, 0);
   
   // If there's a monthly overpayment, analyze its impact
   if (maxMonthlyAmount > 0) {
     const impact = calculationService.analyzeOverpaymentImpact(...);
     setImpactData(impact);
   }
   ```
   If the user has only one-time, quarterly, or annual overpayments, `maxMonthlyAmount` would be 0, and `impactData` would remain null.

## Proposed Fix

We need to modify the code to handle all types of overpayments, not just monthly ones. Here's the plan:

1. **Modify the impact data calculation logic**:
   - Consider all types of overpayments, not just monthly ones
   - Use a default amount for analysis if no monthly overpayment is found
   - Add console logs for debugging

2. **Specific code changes**:
   ```javascript
   // Calculate impact data when overpayment results are available
   useEffect(() => {
     if (overpaymentResults && loanDetails.overpaymentPlans && loanDetails.overpaymentPlans.length > 0) {
       console.log("Overpayment plans:", loanDetails.overpaymentPlans);
       
       // Find the maximum monthly overpayment amount
       let maxMonthlyAmount = loanDetails.overpaymentPlans.reduce((max, plan) => {
         if (plan.frequency === 'monthly') {
           return Math.max(max, plan.amount);
         }
         return max;
       }, 0);
       
       // If no monthly overpayment, use the first overpayment amount as a base
       if (maxMonthlyAmount === 0 && loanDetails.overpaymentPlans.length > 0) {
         maxMonthlyAmount = loanDetails.overpaymentPlans[0].amount / 10; // Use a smaller amount for non-monthly plans
         console.log("No monthly overpayment found, using default amount:", maxMonthlyAmount);
       }
       
       // Always analyze impact as long as there's an overpayment plan
       if (loanDetails.overpaymentPlans.length > 0) {
         console.log("Analyzing impact with amount:", maxMonthlyAmount);
         const impact = calculationService.analyzeOverpaymentImpact(
           loanDetails,
           maxMonthlyAmount * 2, // Analyze up to double the amount
           5 // 5 data points
         );
         console.log("Impact data calculated:", impact);
         setImpactData(impact);
       }
     }
   }, [overpaymentResults, loanDetails]);
   ```

## Testing Approach

After implementing the fix, we should test with different types of overpayment plans:
1. Monthly overpayments
2. One-time overpayments
3. Quarterly overpayments
4. Annual overpayments
5. Mixed overpayment types

## Front-End Testing Capabilities

For testing this component, I would recommend:

1. **Unit Tests with Jest and React Testing Library**:
   - Test that the component renders correctly with different overpayment scenarios
   - Mock the calculationService to return predictable data
   - Verify that the chart is created with the correct data

2. **Example Test**:
   ```javascript
   import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
   import LoanSummary from './LoanSummary';
   import { calculationService } from '@/lib/services/calculationService';

   // Mock the calculationService
   jest.mock('@/lib/services/calculationService', () => ({
     calculationService: {
       analyzeOverpaymentImpact: jest.fn()
     }
   }));

   test('renders impact analysis panel when overpayments exist', () => {
     // Mock data
     const mockImpactData = [
       { amount: 100, interestSaved: 5000, termReduction: 2 },
       { amount: 200, interestSaved: 10000, termReduction: 4 }
     ];
     
     // Setup mock
     calculationService.analyzeOverpaymentImpact.mockReturnValue(mockImpactData);
     
     // Render component with overpayment data
     render(<LoanSummary 
       calculationResults={{...}} 
       overpaymentResults={{...}} 
       loanDetails={{
         overpaymentPlans: [{ amount: 200, frequency: 'one-time' }]
       }} 
     />);
     
     // Check if the panel is rendered
     expect(screen.getByText(/THESE OVERPAYMENTS SAVE YOU/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
   });
