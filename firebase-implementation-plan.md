## Detailed Plan: Separating the App into Client and Server Components using Firebase

This document outlines the detailed plan for separating the mortgage calculator app into client and server components using Firebase as the Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform.

### 1. Architecture

*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, React Query
*   **Backend:** Firebase Functions (Node.js), Firebase Authentication, Firestore
*   **Payment Processing:** Stripe

### 2. Technologies

*   React
*   TypeScript
*   React Query
*   Firebase
*   Firebase Functions
*   Firebase Authentication
*   Firestore
*   Stripe

### 3. Implementation Steps

*   **Set up Firebase project:**
    *   Create a new Firebase project in the Firebase console.
    *   Enable Firebase Authentication and Firestore.
*   **Install Firebase SDK:**
    *   Install the Firebase SDK in the client-side React app:
        ```bash
        npm install firebase
        ```
    *   Install the Firebase Admin SDK in the Firebase Functions:
        ```bash
        npm install firebase-admin
        ```
*   **Implement User Authentication:**
    *   Use Firebase Authentication to handle user registration, login, and logout.
    *   Store user data in Firestore.
    *   Implement authentication UI components in the React app.
    *   Secure the React app routes based on authentication status.
*   **Move Calculation Logic to Firebase Functions:**
    *   Create Firebase Functions to handle the calculation logic.
    *   Implement API endpoints for each calculation function.
    *   The client-side React app would call these functions via API requests using React Query.
*   **Implement Stripe Integration:**
    *   Create Firebase Functions to handle Stripe payment processing.
    *   Implement API endpoints for creating subscriptions, handling webhooks, etc.
    *   The client-side React app would call these functions to initiate payments.
*   **Store Client-Specific Data in Firestore:**
    *   Store client-specific data in Firestore, secured by Firebase Authentication rules.
    *   Implement data access and management logic in the React app.
*   **Deploy Firebase Functions:**
    *   Deploy the Firebase Functions to the Firebase cloud:
        ```bash
        firebase deploy --only functions
        ```
*   **Update Client-Side React App:**
    *   Update the client-side React app to use the Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and Firebase Functions.
    *   Implement error handling and loading states in the React app.
*   **Test the Application:**
    *   Test the application thoroughly to ensure that all features are working correctly.
    *   Write unit tests for the Firebase Functions.
    *   Test the authentication, data storage, and payment processing functionalities.
*   **Deploy the Application:**
    *   Deploy the client-side React app to a hosting platform like Render or Azure.
    *   Configure the hosting platform to serve the React app.
    *   Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.

This plan provides a high-level overview of the steps required to separate the app into client and server components using Firebase. Each step will require further detailed planning and implementation.
